# Installing Custom Plugins in Grafana - Dev

Copy the plugins in this directory to the main grafana's plugin directory.

### Directory: 
<GRAFANA_REPO>/data/plugins

[For creating a plugin for yourself in Grafana, Refer here to the steps.](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/plugins/)

[Grafana 7.0 Plugin Development Tutorial](https://youtu.be/4RLoHg4G9MI)

### Build and packaging

You can build & package your grafana plugin using the below command

```node
yarn build

mvn clean package
```

Note: We have disabled eslint validation in the react code owing to limitation in the yarn commands of 'dev' and 'build'. With the same in place you can execute the below commands during development from the plugin directory which you will be working with,

1. For installing the dependencies and setting up the yarn config file,

```node
yarn install
```

2. For development, 
	a. To have the plugin changes built locally & served use the below:
	
	```node
	yarn dev
	```
	b. To have the plugin changes to be loaded automatically or served in real time:
	
	```node
	yarn watch
	```
3. To build package for production

```node
yarn build
```

4. To pack the content for production

```node
mvn clean package
```

The zip archive can be shipped for deployment into the grafana software's directory -> <GRAFANA_REPO>/data/plugin/
